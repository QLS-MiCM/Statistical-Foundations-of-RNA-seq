## Coding Notebook

Here you can find the R notebook (.Rmd file) that demonstrates the concepts from the workshop as well as a diffrential gene expression analysis example using edgeR package.

The folder contains two subfolders: Data and Scripts. The Scripts folder contains the R notebook, and the Data folder contains the two data files: one is the actual count matrix, the other is the correspondence between geneID and gene names. After downloading them, please make sure the two data files are placed in the same folder as the R notebook when running the R code.
